Our students come for all walks of life and from as far a field as Wolverhampton, South Birmingham and Leamington Spa.


Come and join us, celebrate yourself and connect to your highest consciousness.  You'll have to do the work to initiate the self; but we're here encourage you and point you in the right direction.
